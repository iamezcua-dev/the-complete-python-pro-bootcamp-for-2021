## Printing to the Console

# Instructions

Write a program in main.py that prints the some notes from the previous lesson using what you have learnt about the Python print function.

**Warning:** The output in your program should match the example output shown below exactly, character for character, even spaces and symbols should be identical, otherwise the tests won't pass.

# Example Output

After you have written your code, you should run your program and it should print the following:

```text
Day 1 - Python Print Function
The function is declared like this:
print('what to print')
```

When you execute **`python main.py`**, this more or less what you should see:

# Test Your Code

Once you have finished, test your code by running the `run_tests.sh` script like this: 

```sh
chmod +x run_tests.sh
sh run_tests.sh
```
